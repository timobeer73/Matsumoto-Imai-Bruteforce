# Optimization(s):
- optimize reduceMatrix() by exactly calculating the position of the pivot element instead of iterating upwards through the rows until the pivot element is reached

# Idea(s):
- instead of using eval(), calculate variables by reading operators from the string
- add threading for the function calculateCipherText()
